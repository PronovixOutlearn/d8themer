<!-- @section, "title" : "Part 00 - Installing Drupal 8" -->

In this first episode of Drupal 8 Theming tutorial series we are going to do mandatory Drupal 8 installation on your local machine.
In this Drupal 8 tutorial series we are going to make a fully functional Drupal 8 theme from scratch without the help of any kind of starter themes or child themes. But before we begin with all that we are just going to quickly install Drupal 8 and get ready for the real work that is ahead of us.

<!-- @section, "title" : "Part 19 - Rewriting Views Fields" -->

In this last video of the Drupal 8 Theming series I'm going to show you how you can rewrite the output of fields that you use in your Views.
You will need to do this if you want to have specific HTML output of your Views fields for what ever reason.
We are going to change the output of our movies section. This is not really necessary on our site but there are some real life examples where that would be needed.
Also this is going to be last episode of Drupal 8 Theming for some time. Please leave your suggestions in the comments below for specific problems you might want to see in these videos. And I will do a video about it if I think it could help people.
Thank you for watching this series, the new one starts real soon.

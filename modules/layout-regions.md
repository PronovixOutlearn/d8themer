<!-- @section, "title" : "Part 04 - Blocks and Regions" -->

In this Drupal 8 Theming tutorial we are going to be looking at setting up Drupal regions and adding blocks of content to them.
Drupal 8 and all the other "Drupals" have something called regions, they are locations on your page where you can put pieces of content or functionality. You do that among other things by adding blocks to them.
Blocks are "containers" that contain some content or functionality in them. You can easily move them around the regions by just dragging them in Drupal administration. Pretty great stuff.

<!-- @section, "title" : "Part 05 - Let's Update Drupal 8" -->

In this episode of Drupal 8 Theming we are going to update Drupal 8 core from version 8.0.0-rc4 to official release version.
If you tuned in to these videos later you probably already have the official release of Drupal 8 installed. But you may want to watch this video because it shows the exact steps that you would need to take to update Drupal 8 minor releases when they come out.
This is valuable knowledge to have because as of yet Drupal doesn't have automatic updates of the core.

<!-- @section, "title" : "Part 06 - Theming the Header" -->

In this episode of Drupal 8 Theming tutorial series we are going to theme our header the 'Drupal way', by using blocks, css, html and Twig.
Also we are going to learn how to define our front page so that we don't use the same template as we would use on other content types. This way our front page will be able to have different type of design.
As for the header we are going to style a block that displays the header, add some css to it and I will show you how to change the path of your logo.
By doing all of this we will get better acquainted with Twigs template hints, and will learn where the stuff on our page is coming from.

<!-- @section, "title" : "Part 08 - Creating Partials" -->

In this episode of Drupal 8 Theming tutorial series we are going to learn how to make our theme a bit more flexible by creating and calling partials.
Partials are a small bits of code that you can reuse all over your theme. If you watched the Buildng Sites With Middleman Series you already know what partials are.
Common use for them is creating separate files for header and footer, so when you do some changes on them you don't have to do it on multiple files, but instead you change just one file and those changes would be visible on any template that is calling that partial.

<!-- @section, "title" : "Part 18 - Taxonomy and Drop Down Menu" -->

In this tutorial we are going to fight our way through some bugs and learn about Drupals taxonomy system, and also how to create drop down menus.
In this episode we are going to run into some trouble with Drupal Views, and Foundation framework won't work as expected. But we are going to work around those problems and learn what taxonomies are in Drupal 8, how you can create one and how you can display them using Views.
We are also going to make a drop down menu for those taxonomies, without the help of Foundation framework because there seems to be a problem with that also. But that's no biggie we know how to make drop downs without some fancy framework :).

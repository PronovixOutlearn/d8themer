# Thanks for your time

Expect some more modules on this learning path in the coming weeks as we'd like to cover some more topics.

We hope you had fun and got a sense of what you can do with Drupal 8. If you can't wait to learn more, head out to [api.d.o](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/8) on our community's central site.
